Product:        Dwarf Mayhem: Into the Depths
Team:           Team EggCatRed

In Dwarf Mayhem, you play as a dwarf whose main objective is to mine your 
way to the core of the earth. The resources that you have mined can be 
traded in for various upgrades in the shop on the surface, but it can 
also weigh you down. As you descend into the depths, you’ll encounter 
various hazards within the environment that will attempt to impede your 
progress. Only through strategic planning, efficient terrain navigation, 
and overcoming dangers would you complete the journey to the core of the 
earth.
